### Step 1 : Footprint the target

You should footprint the target by using various tools such as Sam Spade, nslookup, traceroute,
Nmap, and neotrace to learn about a system, its remote access capabilities, its ports and
services, and the other aspects of its security.

### Step 2: Perform port scanning

You should perform port scanning to detect the firewall to determine the available ports that
uniquely identify the firewalls. If the firewall is detected, then disable a trusted host or perform
banner grabbing to detect the firewall.

### Step 3: Perform banner grabbing

You should perform the banner grabbing technique to detect the services run by the firewall. If
the firewall is detected, then disable a trusted host or perform firewalking to detect the
firewall.

### Step 4: Perform Firewalking

You should use the firewalking technique to determine access information on the firewall when
probe packets are sent. If a firewall is detected, then disable a trusted host.

### Step 6: Perform IP address spoofing

You should perform IP address spoofing to gain unauthorized access t o a computer or a
network.

### Step 7: Perform source routing

### Step 8: Use an IP address in place of URL

### Step 9: Perform a fragmentation attack

You should perform an IP fragmentation ion at tack to force the TCP header information into the
next fragment in order to bypass the firewall.

### Step 10 : Use anonymous website surfing sites

You should use anonymous website surfing sites to hide your identity from the Internet.

### Step 11 : Use proxy servers

You should use proxy servers that block the actual IP address and display another, thereby
allowing access to the blocked website.

### Step 12 : Perform ICMP tunneling

You should perform ICMP tunneling to tunnel a backdoor application in the data portion of
ICMP Echo packets.

### Step 14 : Perform ACK tunneling

You should perform ACK tunneling using tools such as _AckCmd_ to tunnel backdoor application
with TCP packets with t he ACK bit set.
Step 15 : Use external systems

### Step 16: Perform MITM Attack

You should perform an MITM attack in order to own corporate the DNS server or to spoof DNS
replies to it.

### Step 17: Document all the findings
