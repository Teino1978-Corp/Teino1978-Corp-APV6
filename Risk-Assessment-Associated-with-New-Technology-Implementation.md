### Risk Assessments 
Are maintained by both the tester and the analyst for all data gathered to support a valid assessment through non-privileged testing. This implies that if too little or improper data has been gathered then it may not be possible to provide a valid risk assessment and the tester should therefore rely on best practices, the client’s industry regulations, the client’s business justifications, the client’s security policy, and the legal issues for the client and the client’s regions for doing business.
Risk Evaluation
Risk means that limits in the security presence will have a detrimental effect on people, culture information, processes, business, image, intellectual property, legal rights, or intellectual capital. This manual maintains four dimensions in testing for a minimal risk state environment:

Safety

All tests must exercise concern for worst case scenarios at the greatest expenses. This requires the tester to hold above all else the regard for human safety in physical and emotional health and occupation.

Privacy

All tests must exercise regard for the right to personal privacy regardless of the regional law. The ethics and understanding for privacy are often more advanced then current legislation.

Practicality

All tests must be engineered for the most minimal complexity, maximum viability, and deepest clarity.

Usability

All tests must stay within the frame of usable security. That which is most secure is the least welcoming and forgiving. The tests within this manual are performed to seek a usable level of security (also known as practical security).
